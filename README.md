# Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Sector

## Project Overview
In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial. 
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing factors contributing to churn, we aim to implement targeted strategies that improve customer retention.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to reproduce and expand upon three key research papers related to customer churn prediction in the telecom sector:
1. **Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning Techniques**
2. **Implementing Machine Learning Techniques for Customer Retention and Churn Prediction in Telecommunications**
3. **Explaining Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry Using Tabular Machine Learning Models**

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is related to customer churn in telecommunications, and it is provided with a detailed description. This dataset will serve as the foundation for our analysis and model training.

## Requirements
This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, structured as follows:
1. **Business Understanding**: Define the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collect and explore the dataset to understand its characteristics and quality.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Apply various machine learning techniques to build predictive models.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the models using relevant metrics to determine their effectiveness.
6. **Deployment**: Implement the model in a production environment and monitor its performance.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating each step of the CRISP-DM process.
- A comprehensive report summarizing findings and insights.
